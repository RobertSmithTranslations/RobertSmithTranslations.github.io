    <h3>Rates for translation work</h3>
    <p>In principle, my rate for translation work is <strong>â‚¬ 0.15/word, ex. VAT</strong>.</p>
    
    <p>That makes it easy to calculate the price for a simple translation. Just <u>multiply the word count shown at the bottom right of the Word document by .15, then add 21% for the VAT</u>.</p>
    <p>But the final price might actually be much lower. To make my work easier, and to avoid translating the same sentences over and over, I use the translation tool MemoQ.</p>
    <p>MemoQ stores every sentence or fragment I've ever translated as 'segments'. And if that segment ever comes back in another translation, the tool automatically recalls it from the translation memory.</p>
    <p>So say your document is a list, table or Excel sheet, and the same words or phrases are repeated over and over. In that case, I would only bill for the first repetition.</p>
    <p>Or say that I've translated an older version of the document, such as an HR manual or a website. In that case, I would only bill for the new changes or additions. The translation memory would fill in the rest.</p>
    <p>That means the more I translate for your organisation, the less you'd pay over time!</p>
