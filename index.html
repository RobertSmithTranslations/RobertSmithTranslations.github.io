    <p>Robert Smith, like so many English speakers, came to the Netherlands for love:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>love of cycling,</li> 
        <li>love of history,</li>
        <li>and love of the relaxed, colourfully idiomatic dialect of German that we call the Dutch language.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>He enrolled in the History programme at Utrecht University in 1999. Through courses in early modern Dutch history and palaeography, he quickly became fluent in spoken and written Dutch. Fluent enough that before he finished his degree, he had already found a job as a translator.</p>
    <p>It wasn’t long before he realised that he could earn more money – and charge his clients less – if he started working as a freelancer. So in 2009, he founded his own company: Robert Smith Translations.</p>
    <p>His very first client was the communications department at a faculty of Utrecht University. The university has been a steady client ever since. But others soon joined:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the Foundation for Banking Ethics Enforcement (DSI)</li> 
        <li>the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ)</li>
        <li>Nederlandse Spoorwegen (NS)</li>
        <li>Rabobank</li>
        <li>Capgemini</li>
    </ul>
